# kit's proof that the substrate install is real, and that its pins are exact.
#
#   bash tests/substrate_test.sh
#
# WHAT THIS IS FOR
#   `templates/substrate/install.sh` is the customer-facing one-command install.
#   It cannot be EXECUTED on a development machine — it needs root, a Linux
#   kernel, a container runtime and a reachable registry — so the claims it
#   makes are otherwise untested. This script proves the parts that can be
#   proven without a box: the script parses, DRY_RUN runs to completion
#   printing the ordered steps, every pin is exact, every manifest parses, the
#   two ClusterIssuers are staging and prod with distinct account keys, the
#   Postgres Cluster reproduces the local provisioning contract, the Redis
#   image is pinned exact, the recorded secret name-and-key list matches what
#   install.sh creates, no image floats on `latest`, and no secret is a
#   literal in the tree.
#
# EVERY CLAIM HAS A CONTROL THAT MUST ANSWER DIFFERENTLY.
#   A check that passes against an empty directory is not a check. So each
#   check below is run twice: once against the real tree (must be GREEN) and
#   once against a fixture built to violate exactly that one property (must
#   be RED). The pin check's control is the one the packet names — a fixture
#   with a `latest` pin goes red under the same check the real tree passes.
#   A control that does not go red is reported as a failure of the test itself.
#
# WHAT IS NOT PROVEN HERE
#   That k3s installs, that Argo syncs, that the charts exist. Those need a
#   customer box. `templates/substrate/README.md` says so in the same words.
